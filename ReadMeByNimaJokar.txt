The "compact-coach-ex" folder contains the assets (Images,GIFs), Node Modules containing every npm module used, Screens & App.js containing all the code for Compact-Coach.

If you wish to run the code, you must run it within an android emulator ( Android Studio ). 

To Run the Code , after entering the directory, Enter "npx expo start -c" into the Visual Studio Code Terminal and open ExpoGo on your emulator.

I will be using the Android Emulator by Android Studio to Demonstrate my applications capabilities.
